About composerized Contao core.
===============================

This repository contains an unofficial version of the Contao Core.

The only contents are tagged versions (all versions released by Contao)
with the addition of a composer.json which allows to pull in the Core as
dependency via composer.

This is useful when unit testing Contao extensions etc. and is not intended
for new installations or the like.

As already noted, this version is unofficial and not maintained by the Contao
team and therefore no support is given by those.
